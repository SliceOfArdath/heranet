      Hello!</br>
      As per my last email, here is the document, cleaned up. I don’t have the right tools for digitization with me yet, so that’s why the picture doesn’t look great. I also attached a quick translation, tell me if I got anything wrong.</br>
      As you’ll see the excerpt is missing begging and stars midway through a sentence, I don’t know if we’ll find the rest of the page, but I have high hopes!</br>
      Anyway I do have questions too, and I hope you can answer them:</br>
      Who is this Berg? I feel like I hear that name a few times already, but I’m really not sure who that could be.</br>
      Do you think you could make a good guess as to when, or where this was written from the context of the document?</br>
      </br>
      Have a great rest of your day!</br>
      Take care,</br>
      Lisa Deryn</br>

        [...] Berg at the door. Then I went and talked to the Innkeeper. A nice boy, gave me a room free of charge, “for my services” he said it was. I don’t really like that, but what the gods(?). There was a bard, started playing after the sun went down. Everyone liked it, I think. The innkeeper’s kids came down to listen to the music. The bard played <i>Ea nes de tiza</i>(?). 
        I don’t like the song, but he played it well. The innkeeper, Baron was his name, served me a plate, soup with some <i>æne</i>(?), I found it well.</br>
        The big room started to empty, it was time to sleep. I wished good night to the innkeeper and his heart-shell(???), and went to sleep.
