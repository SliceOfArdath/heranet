      Hello Dr Deryn,</br>
      I want, firstly, to reiterate my thanks for contacting me, these documents are an incredible discovery, and I, for one, am thrilled to be able to work on such matters. 
      As for the document you sent me, your translation was pretty much on point, at least as to grasp the general meaning. Now though, there were some errors. Apart from these, spot, on!
      You translated "<i>Alla es teraos</i>" as "what the Gods", and while this translation is accurate on a word-for-word basis, it was usually used to mean something along the lines of "Whatever". More accurately, because no translation can be perfect, it is a shortening of "What would the Gods do about [...]", being a rethorical question, to which the answer would be "Nothing".
      You also used the word "Bard" for "<i>Elleseth</i>", and while this is absolutely correct, I feel obligated to mention that, as the profession of Bard was different, using such a word might be misleading, although I still very much do understand the choice.
      <i>Ea nes de tiza</i> is, if my books on the subject are correct, the folk song of "The Lady Of The Dragon", although the current version is very much differrent from the original. I will have to ask around to see if I can find someone with more knowledge than I on this particuliar matter.
      <i>æne</i> is a type of mutton now extint, I think I know someone who made a thesis on this species. 
      "heart-shell" is a common error when translating the old tongue. To keep it simple, it is what you would say of someone dear to your heart. In this case, a spouse I imagine.
      </br>
      Now for you questions.</br>
      How could you forget about Brego? It is, as I would hope you know, her horse, and companion over the course of frourty years. I even think it has an entire Battlesong dedicated to it!</br>
      Now for the time and place, I do have some ideas, but it is hard to guess from so little. From the song, it obviously has to be after 1222, but I would place it at least at 1224. And for the place, well, to be honest, the only clue I do have is the </i>Elleseth</i>. Since we have here a very complete recording of their whereabouts for the last millenia, I will try to see if I can find anything in the archives. But at least, we can safely place her somewhere in the nothern plains, I think.</br>
      </br>
      Again, thanks a lot for having me in such a project. I cannot state how exited I am to be a part of this.</br>
      PS: I also included my own translation of the document, I hope it will help in your understanding of the subject.</br>

        [I left] Brego at the door, then I went and talked to the Innkeeper. A good man, who gave me a room free of charge, “for my services” he said it was. I don’t really like that, but whatever. There was a bard, who started playing after sunset. Everyone liked it, I think. The Innkeeper’s kids came down to listen to the music. The bard played The Lady Of The Dragon. 
        I don’t really like the song, still he played it well. Baron, the Innkeeper, served me a soup with some lamb, which I found tasty.</br>
        The main room started to empty, it was time to sleep. I wished good night to the innkeeper and his spouse, and went to sleep.
