      Hi! Thanks a lot for your answer!</br>
      I didn't know you worked for the empire. Anyway, I would really be interested in getting some information about <i>Ea nes de tiza</i>, I do believe that i have seen it mentioned a few times more on the other pages we started to clean up. Maybe this could help in having a better idea of when this all took place!
      I dont have anything to give you yet (the documents arent yet ready), I'll send you another mail when I do.</br>
      Also, something that kept me up last night, is why we would find such documents in the middle of the shifting plains, of all places. Do you have any idea?</br>
      By the way, I included a picture of the dig site!
      </br>
      Take care,</br>
      Lisa Deryn</br>
      You can call me Lisa ;)</br>
